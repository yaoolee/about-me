    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <br>
    <p>Hello everyone, My name is <em>Yao Tiem Lee.</em> Currently I am a student of Humber College and enrolled to a program which is <strong> Web Development. </strong> I have completed my postgraduate from Fleming College which is International Business Management. I decided to pursue Web Development as I wanted to learn something new and interesting though I am coming from a completely different background. </p>
    <p>Overall, My goal is to learn Web Development using different technologies, make new friends and build up my networking at Humber College. Please feel free to connect with me on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/athaaii/"> Instagram</a></p>
